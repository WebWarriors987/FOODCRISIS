CRISISFOOD

IT IS A SOLUTION FOR PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR CORONAVIRUS.

DUE TO THE RECENT COVID19 CRISIS, MANY PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR JOBS AND A LOT OF DAILY WAGE WORKERS ARE NOT GETTING FOOD TO EAT.
MANY PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO DONATE MONEY IN THESE TIMES TO HELP OTHERS BUT ARE NOT ABLE TO FIND SUITABLE NGOs OR INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR AREA.
MANY NGOs ARE IN NEED OF MONEY TO CARRY OUT THEIR WORK.

OUR WEB APP COMES HERE WHICH WILL BRIDGE THIS GAP AND HELP DONORS TO DONATE MONEY IN THESE HARD TIMES TO NGOs OR PERSONS WHO NEED THESE FINANCIAL SUPPORT SO THAT EVERYONE GETS THEIR BASIC NEEDS.

WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER FEATURES IN OUR MIND WHICH WE COULD IMPLEMENT THESE IN OUR APP IN FUTURE EXTENDING THESE WEB API'S APPLICABILITY.
